# Starc Archive
I created this site to keep track of all the new things I learn or add to my blog. I also use it to add commits every day so that I can get the green box in my profile (I know, I know, that's low. I got Issues).

Anyway, I plan to learn new things every day to create something amazing on my own or get hired in a high-paying job. Either way, I want to learn many things. I have a huge list of things I want to learn.

I am thrilled to start this journey.

See you later...

I am using the free webflow site plan, so I have to create a new site when I reach my limit on how many posts I can make.

5.9.24 - I have created a private site and repository to document things I learn but do not want to share with anyone. I might learn things that I am not proud of but still want to track my progress. You might wonder, why I don't just make the repository private. Well, the free version of GitHub does not allow you to host private repository pages. 
So, yeah here we are. i want to see all data in simple site. so used the pubilc repo and hosted the site on github pages and made other links as a private gated content.- <a href="https://github.com/StephenStarc/Starc-Archive-Private">Starc Archive Private</a>

12.9.24 - Hooray! No need to have multiple Webflow sites anymore. I have created a brand new article site from scratch using React and Firebase. It has sufficient features to create and store articles, but it's not enough. I plan to create something even better in the future. For now, this is good. Check out our new article site - <a href="https://starc-archive.netlify.app/">Starc Article</a>

I can make both public and private posts within one site, eliminating the need for multiple sites. However, the posts are separated into their own repositories. For Now, we will use all the available space on the free webflow site we are currently using, and when that's full, we will move to a new site..
