Sure, here is the revised text:

# Starc Archive
I created this site to keep track of all the new things I learn or add to my blog. I also use it to add commits every day so that I can get the green box in my profile (I know, I know, that's low. I got Issues).

Anyway, I plan to learn new things every day to create something amazing on my own or get hired in a high-paying job. Either way, I want to learn many things. I have a huge list of things I want to learn.

I am thrilled to start this journey.

See you later...

I am using the free webflow site plan, so I have to create a new site when I reach my limit on how many posts I can make.
